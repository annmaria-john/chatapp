# CHATAPP

### This project is a real-time chat application built using Python and the WebSocket protocol. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter and aims to provide a platform for studying protocol design, security, and vulnerabilities. The application intentionally includes backdoors to understand and exploit vulnerabilities.

##### Github URL : https://github.com/annmaria-john/chatapp.git 


#### Compilation
1.	Install python3 on your local machine.
2.	Download the zip file and extract the chat app folder. There should be two folders – client and server.
3.	Inside the two folders there is the client and server python code. For each python code you need to install the following dependencies using “pip install” - 
a.	rsa
b.	websockets
c.	asyncio
d.	tkinter
4.	Open the terminal and change to client directory to run the client code – 
python clientcode_web.py
5.	Open the terminal and change to server directory to run the server code – 
python servercode_web.py
6.	This opens up the server on the port 8080 and the client will connect to this default port unless an argument is specified.

#### Configuration
1.	Client to server(only)
a.	Run the server code with the following optional parameters
python servercode_web.py –host <IP Address> --port <port number>
b.	The host parameter is the IP address of your server and the port number is the port where the server listens.
c.	Run the client code with the following optional parameters
python clientcode_web.py --host <IP Address> --port <port number>
d.	The host parameter is the IP address of your client and the port number is the port where the client connects.
2.	Client to server to server to client
a.	Run the server code with the following required parameters
python servercode_web.py. 
b.	This opens up our first server on port 8080(for client connections) and port 5050(for server to server connections)
c.	Run the server code with the following required parameters
python servercode_web.py --port 2020 --serverport 5051
d.	This opens up our second server on port 2020(for client connections) and port 5051(for server to server connections)
e.	Run the client code 
python clientcode_web.py 
f.	The first client by default connects to the port 8080
g.	Run the client code with the following required parameters
python clientcode_web.py --port 2020 
h.	This opens up the second client which connects to the port 2020

#### Assumptions
1.	Server to Server communication can handle only 1-1 messages and 1-all messages(no file sharing and group messaging)
2.	You can only transfer files for 1-1 client communication, not group communication
3.	For server to server communication, the two servers have to serve their s2s connection on port 5050 and 5051.
